# ## Hotel Reservations Dataset
# ### Can you predict if customer is going to cancel the reservation ?

# The online hotel reservation channels have dramatically changed booking possibilities and customersâ€™ behavior. A significant number of hotel reservations are called-off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with.
# 
# ### Can you predict if the customer is going to honor the reservation or cancel it ?

# #### Booking_ID: unique identifier of each booking
# 
# #### no_of_adults: Number of adults

# 
# #### type_of_meal_plan: Type of meal plan booked by the customer:
# 
# #### required_car_parking_space: Does the customer require a car parking space? (0 - No, 1- Yes)
# 
# #### room_type_reserved: Type of room reserved by the customer. The values are ciphered (encoded) by INN Hotels.
# 
# #### lead_time: Number of days between the date of booking and the arrival date
# 
# #### arrival_year: Year of arrival date
# 
# #### arrival_month: Month of arrival date
# 
# #### arrival_date: Date of the month
# 
# #### market_segment_type: Market segment designation.
# 
# #### repeated_guest: Is the customer a repeated guest? (0 - No, 1- Yes)

# #### no_of_previous_cancellations: Number of previous bookings that were canceled by the customer prior to the current booking
# 
# #### no_of_previous_bookings_not_canceled: Number of previous bookings not canceled by the customer prior to the current booking
# 
# #### avg_price_per_room: Average price per day of the reservation; prices of the rooms are dynamic. (in euros)
